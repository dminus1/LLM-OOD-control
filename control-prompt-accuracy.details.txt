Below, there are 10 texts. Classify each of them into either Class 1 or Class 2 based on the examples above. When classifying, don't use the topic of the text as a criteria. You SHOULD NOT be using topical content or size of the texts for classification!  The focus should be on how the texts are written, not what they are about. The examples above can be limited to particular topics. However, your classification should be universally applicable to any text regardless of the specific topical area such as business, finances, entertainment, universities, markets, science, politics, travel, health, councils, software, sports, religion, arts, law, nature, history, engineering, school, etc.
Present your response in the list format as in the example below. No explanations are needed. There should be nothing else in the output, just this list.

Example of output:
1: Class 1
2: Class 2
3: Class 1
4: Class 1
5: Class 1
6: Class 2
7: Class 2
8: Class 2
9: Class 2
